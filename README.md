## Summary
The Jupyter Notebook included uses the features in a dataset containing more than 34,000 organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup (fictitious venture capital firm) to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether a future applicant will become successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The binary classification model employed uses a deep neural network. The three technical deliverables are the following:

* Preprocessing of data for a neural network model.

* Using the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

* Optimizing the model.
